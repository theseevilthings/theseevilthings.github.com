Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? You don't believe in the Force, do you? Partially, but it also obeys your commands. What!? A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.

##The Republic
What?! Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possiblyâ€¦ Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. I'm trying not to, kid.

Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.
I'm trying not to, kid.
Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.

The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.

##The Rebel Force
Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. You don't believe in the Force, do you? I find your lack of faith disturbing. Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think?

Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone.
A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.
Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.

##Imperial Star Destroyer
The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. You don't believe in the Force, do you? The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.
