<h1>Is she dead, yes or no?</h1>
<p>My money's in that office, right? If she start giving me some bullshit about
it ain't there, and we got to go someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you
in the head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in the kneecaps,
find out where my goddamn money is. She gonna tell me too. Hey, look at me when
I'm talking to you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that nigga
Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first mothen I'm gonna shoot that
bitch in the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She gonna tell me
too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in
there, and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first
motherfucker to get shot. You understand? </p>

<h1>Are you ready for the truth?</h1>
<p>Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. This gun is
advertised as the most popular gun in American crime. Do you believe that shit?
It actually says that in the little book that comes with it: the most popular
gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud of that shit.  </p>

<h1>Is she dead, yes or no?</h1>
<p>Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria
and viruses differently than mine. You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear.
But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We swallow it
too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may
seem, we are connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite
ends. </p>

<h1>Uuummmm, this is a tasty burger!</h1>
<p>Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all
makes sense! In a comic, you know how you can tell who the arch-villain's going
to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like
you and me! I should've known way back when... You know why, David? Because of
the kids. They called me Mr Glass. </p>
